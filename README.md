## Setup Guide
You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=417QjymeOMk) I made or follow the steps below. 

These are instructions for regular OBS Studio, but I imagine you can do the same with other streaming software:
- Dowmload the ZIP file.
- Extract somewhere.
- Drag and drop `Game Scoreboard.html` into OBS, or add a new browser source in OBS pointing at the local file.
- If the source looks weird, manually set the source's propierties to 1920 width and 1080 height, or set your OBS canvas resolution to 1080p, or make the source fit the screen.
- In the source's propierties, change *Use custom frame rate* -> `60` (if streaming at 60fps of course).
- **Also tick** `Refresh browser when scene becomes active`.
- Manage it all with the `Ultimate ST` executable.

Repeat from the 3rd step to add the `VS Screen.html` and `Caster Screen.html`, though I recommend you to do so on another scene.

### Interface shortcuts!
- Press `Enter` to update.
- Press either `F1` or `F2` to increase P1's or P2's score.
- Press `ESC` to clear player info.

2 basic transitions are included in the `Resources/OBS Transitions` folder, if you don't have a transition yourself of course. To use them on OBS:
- Add a new stinger transition.
- Set the video file to `Game In.webm` or `Swoosh.webm`.
- Transition point -> `350 ms`.
- I recommend you to set the Audio Fade Style to crossfade, just in case.
- On the scene's right click menu, set it to Transition Override to the transition you just created.

The interface will also update basic text files with the match info at `Resources/Texts/Simple Texts/` so you can add them to OBS with ease.

## Customizing stuff

If you want to customize the GUI, thats going to be a bit complicated since you will have to learn how electron works yourself. In any case, the source code is also on this github!

It is possible to customize how your Scoreboard, VS Screen and Caster Screen look by replacing the files in the overlay folder.

You can also replace the logo simply by adding a 200x200 resolution one.

While to change the position of the icons and writings you should modify parts of the code contained in the `html` and `js` files.

## Development Stream Graphics

Run local web server to have access to local files and check styling
- npx http-server -o ./Stream-Tool

## Development Stream Tool GUI

- folder structure needs to stay the same (also Stream-Tool)
- use `yarn start` to start a local electron development application
- use `yarn package` or similar command (see `package.json`) to build the application for usage.
